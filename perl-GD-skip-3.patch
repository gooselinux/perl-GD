Skip test 3, it does not work; the blue collor is replaced by white.
broken both in dist-f12 and dist-f13 in koji.
Not reproduced outside koji yet.

To get the broken image, run "perl t/GD.t --write" and look at
"t/test.out.3.png_new".

Important observation:
It is important that test3() gets called; if it is skipped, then
test 6 below fails.  Looks like a memory allocation issue...
